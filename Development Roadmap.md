## **🎯 Key Milestones & Deliverables**

|Phase|Duration|Key Deliverable|Success Criteria|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1**|3 weeks|Auth System|Users can login/register|
|**2**|3 weeks|Hetzner Integration|Basic server operations work|
|**3**|4 weeks|Complete Features|All core features functional|
|**4**|3 weeks|Polish & Monitoring|Production-ready performance|
|**5**|3 weeks|Launch Ready|All tests pass, deployed|

## **👥 Resource Requirements**

- **Weeks 1-6**: 2 developers (1 Laravel, 1 FastAPI)
- **Weeks 7-13**: 3 developers (2 backend, 1 frontend)
- **Weeks 14-16**: Full team + DevOps

## **⚠️ Risk Factors & Mitigation**

|Risk|Impact|Mitigation|
|---|---|---|
|Hetzner API changes|High|Version lock, comprehensive error handling|
|WorkOS integration delays|Medium|Build basic auth fallback first|
|Performance issues|Medium|Early load testing, caching strategy|
|Security vulnerabilities|High|Regular audits, security-first approach|

## **📊 Go/No-Go Checkpoints**

1. **End of Phase 1**: Authentication working? ✓/✗
2. **End of Phase 2**: Can create/manage servers? ✓/✗
3. **End of Phase 3**: All core features complete? ✓/✗
4. **End of Phase 4**: Performance benchmarks met? ✓/✗
5. **End of Phase 5**: Security audit passed? ✓/✗

## **🚀 Post-Launch Roadmap** (Future Phases)

**Phase 6 (Month 5)**:

- Mobile app development
- Advanced automation
- API v2 planning

**Phase 7 (Month 6)**:

- Horizontal scaling implementation
- Multi-region support
- Enterprise features

---

**This roadmap provides**:

- Clear timelines and phases
- Specific deliverables per phase
- Success criteria and checkpoints
- Resource planning
- Risk management
- Future growth path

You can adjust the timelines based on your team size and complexity requirements. Each phase builds on the previous one, ensuring a stable foundation before adding complexity.
