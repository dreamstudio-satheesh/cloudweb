# Cloud Hosting Management Platform - Development Requirements

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Build a production-ready, full-stack cloud hosting management platform that provides secure access to Hetzner Cloud resources through separate admin and client interfaces.

**Architecture Pattern**: Microservices with clear separation of concerns
